# My First Steps in Web Development with a Daenerys Meme! 🔥👑

Hello, everyone! 👋 This is the repository where I will document my first steps in web development, and I've decided to kick it off with a Daenerys meme from Game of Thrones. 🐉

## Objective 💡

The goal of this project is to learn the fundamentals of web development while creating a fun and creative meme page featuring the Mother of Dragons herself, Daenerys Targaryen. 📚

## Initial Project: Daenerys Meme Page 🚀

For my first project, I'm creating a meme page dedicated to Daenerys Targaryen, one of the iconic characters from Game of Thrones. I'll be using HTML and CSS to display hilarious Daenerys memes and quotes.
